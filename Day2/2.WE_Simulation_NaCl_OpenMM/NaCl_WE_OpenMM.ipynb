    "The Weighted Ensemble (WE) method provides a route to estimating kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for many different types of biomolecular simulation problem. For a good introduction, see this [2017 review from Zuckerman and Chong](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28301772/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to illustrate the key aspects of \"steady state\" type WE simulations (walkers, progress coordinates, binning, splitting and merging, recycling) with a version of the sodium chloride association kinetics example that also features in the [WESTPA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26392815/) tutorials, but using `WElib` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a barrier to the formation of a Na+ - Cl- ion pair in solution as the hydration shells that surround each ion - when separated -  must be disrupted. In this Weighted Ensemble simulation, we begin with a box of water containing one sodium and one chloride ion, about 11 Angstroms (1.1 nm) apart. We measure the rate at which this forms an ion pair (defined as <= 2.6 Angstroms apart).\n",
